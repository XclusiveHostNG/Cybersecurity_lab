# Metasploitable Lab

This lab captures my exploration of the Metasploitable 2 vulnerable machine. It focuses on enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation reporting.

## Objectives

- Practice using Nmap and other reconnaissance tools to identify services.
- Exploit common vulnerabilities in web, database, and network services.
- Develop professional write-ups for discovered vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Kali Linux VM configured and reachable on the host-only network.
- Metasploitable VM configured as described in [guides/metasploitable_setup.md](../../guides/metasploitable_setup.md).
- Snapshots created for both VMs to enable quick recovery.

## Lab Flow

1. Complete the [Service Enumeration](service_enumeration.md) exercise.
2. Follow the [Exploitation Walkthrough](exploitation_walkthrough.md) for selected vulnerabilities.
3. Document findings using the [report template](reports/vulnerability_report_template.md).
