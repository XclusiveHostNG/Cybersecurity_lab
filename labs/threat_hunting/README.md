# Threat Hunting Labs

These exercises build defensive muscle memory by analyzing telemetry generated inside the cybersecurity lab. Each lab references data from Security Onion, pfSense, and host-level logs to help detect and respond to simulated attacks.

## Lab Catalog
- [PCAP Analysis](pcap_analysis.md) – Inspect captured traffic to reconstruct an intrusion.
- [Log Correlation](log_correlation.md) – Correlate alerts across pfSense, Zeek, and Suricata.
- [Detection Engineering Sprint](detection_engineering_sprint.md) – Develop Sigma rules to detect credential abuse.

> **Tip:** Clone the lab directories when you want to preserve answers. Keep the original files pristine as templates.
