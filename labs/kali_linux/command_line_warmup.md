# Command Line Warm-Up

This exercise focuses on improving terminal efficiency in Kali Linux.

## Tasks

1. Customize the shell prompt and create aliases for frequently used commands (`ll`, `grep`, `nmap`).
2. Navigate the filesystem to locate key tool directories (`/usr/share/nmap`, `/usr/share/metasploit-framework`).
3. Practice package management with `apt`, including searching, installing, and removing packages.
4. Create a script in `~/scripts` that updates the system and logs results to `/var/log/kali_updates.log`.
5. Document all commands run and lessons learned in `reports/command_line_notes.md`.

## Success Criteria

- Aliases persist across sessions via `.zshrc`.
- Update script runs without errors and produces timestamped entries.
- Notes include at least three shortcuts or tips discovered during the session.
