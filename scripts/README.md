# Scripts

Utility scripts that support the cybersecurity lab by automating repetitive tasks and collecting evidence.

## Available Scripts

- `network_scan.sh` – Performs a host discovery and port scan across the lab network.
- `update_checklist.py` – Tracks patching status for each virtual machine.
- `report_compiler.py` – Aggregates completed lab reports into a single markdown dossier.

Feel free to extend these scripts or add new ones as the lab evolves.
