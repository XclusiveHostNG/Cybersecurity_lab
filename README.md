# Cybersecurity Lab Repository

This repository chronicles the build-out of a personal cybersecurity labâ€”from the first exercises to a full enterprise-style
playgroundâ€”and provides everything needed to recreate or iterate on the setup. Each directory pairs narrative notes with
step-by-step instructions, automation artifacts, and operational runbooks so you can both follow the journey and reproduce the
environment on your own hardware or homelab cluster.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Learn the origin story** in `journey/` to understand the skills developed at each milestone.
2. **Design your topology** using `lab_environment/` where diagrams, build guides, and setup checklists live.
3. **Provision infrastructure** by adapting the automation samples under `automation/` and the VM templates in
   `lab_environment/vm_templates/`.
4. **Operationalize defenses** with the procedures in `operations/` and the hardening + incident response checklists in
   `checklists/`.
5. **Continuously challenge the lab** using the adversary simulations and purple team playbooks under `threat_emulation/`.

> ðŸ’¡ All documentation is written to be technology-agnostic. Replace the virtualization platform, network ranges, or
> automation tooling with your own preferences while keeping the same guiding structure.

## Lab Philosophy

- **Isolation First:** The lab stays segmented from production or personal networks until controls are validated.
- **Document to Automate:** Every manual task is documented so it can be automated later.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Findings from threat emulation and incidents feed back into hardening and documentation updates.
