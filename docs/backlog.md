# Continuous Improvement Backlog

Use this backlog to capture ideas, enhancements, and experiments for the cybersecurity lab. Prioritize items during quarterly
planning and link to issues or documentation updates once work begins.

| Priority | Idea | Description | Owner | Status |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| High | Automate Windows baseline | Convert manual GPO hardening steps into Ansible/PowerShell DSC modules | Blue Team | Backlog |
| High | SIEM cost optimization | Evaluate Elasticsearch hot/warm architecture and storage tiering | Lab Architect | Backlog |
| Medium | Malware detonation zone | Build isolated hypervisor cluster for reversing exercises | Red Team | Backlog |
| Medium | Cloud footprint | Extend Terraform modules to deploy Azure AD + Sentinel lab | Automation Engineer | Backlog |
| Low | Documentation site | Publish static documentation using MkDocs or Docusaurus | Lab Scribe | Backlog |

## Workflow

1. **Capture:** Add new ideas with enough detail that anyone could pick them up.
2. **Refine:** During retrospectives, clarify acceptance criteria and dependencies.
3. **Plan:** Promote prioritized work into Git issues or project boards with due dates.
4. **Complete:** When finished, update status to `Done` and link to the relevant commit or PR.

Remember to keep the backlog actionableâ€”if an item becomes irrelevant, archive it rather than letting it age indefinitely.
