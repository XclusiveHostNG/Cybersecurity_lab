# Automation Artifacts

Automation keeps the lab reproducible and reduces manual toil. This directory contains infrastructure-as-code samples and scripts that can be expanded into a full provisioning pipeline.

- `ansible/` — Inventory and playbooks for hardening and validating lab hosts.
- `terraform/` — *(Placeholder)* future infrastructure modules for cloud-based lab expansions.
- `pipelines/` — *(Placeholder)* CI configurations for automated compliance checks.

> **Note:** Placeholders are intentionally empty to highlight planned areas of growth. Replace them with real code as the lab matures.
