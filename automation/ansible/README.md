# Ansible Automation

The Ansible samples in this directory demonstrate how lab hosts are kept compliant with hardening baselines. They are intended to be run from the Ansible control node located on the management VLAN.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install ansible ansible-lint`.
2. Update `inventory.yml` with the actual host IP addresses or DNS records.
3. Run the hardening playbook: `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/hardening.yml`.
4. Review the generated report under `reports/` for remediation items.

## Structure

- `inventory.yml` — Example inventory grouped by function.
- `playbooks/hardening.yml` — Applies CIS-inspired baseline settings.
- `group_vars/` *(optional)* — Store credentials and variables encrypted with Ansible Vault.
- `reports/` *(optional)* — Directory for compliance output generated by playbooks.
