# Looking Ahead: Expanding the Lab

After stabilizing core services and operational workflows, the next chapter focuses on scaling the lab into hybrid and
cloud-integrated scenarios.

## Cloud Footprint

- Deploy Azure Active Directory and integrate with on-premises AD for hybrid identity experiments.
- Stand up a lightweight AWS VPC with simulated production workloads to practice cross-environment incident response.
- Explore Infrastructure-as-Code pipelines that span on-premises Proxmox and cloud providers using Terraform workspaces.

## Advanced Detection Engineering

- Build detections for living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) using custom Sysmon rules.
- Correlate network and endpoint telemetry using Elastic machine learning jobs.
- Introduce deception technology (honey accounts, honey files) and measure alert fidelity.

## Offensive Security Growth

- Automate phishing simulation campaigns with GoPhish and track metrics over time.
- Experiment with adversary emulation plans referencing MITRE ATT&CK tactics not yet covered in the lab.
- Develop custom implants or tooling in languages like Rust or Nim to bypass standard detections.

## Professional Development

- Mentor peers or community members by hosting virtual lab walkthroughs.
- Publish case studies based on lab exercises to reinforce storytelling skills.
- Pursue advanced certifications (OSCP, GCIA, GCTI) aligned with lab initiatives.

Document progress and lessons learned in this file at least once per quarter. Treat it as a living roadmap that keeps the lab
aligned with evolving career goals.
