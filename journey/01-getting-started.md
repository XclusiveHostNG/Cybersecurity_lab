# Getting Started with Cybersecurity

My cybersecurity journey began with curiosity about how systems fail and how defenders can anticipate attacks. The early days were dedicated to building foundational knowledge:

- **Networking Basics:** Completed Cisco's Introduction to Networking course and labbed VLAN segmentation on Packet Tracer.
- **Operating Systems:** Installed dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu to understand security tooling differences.
- **Programming:** Practiced Python scripting to automate log analysis and simple port scans.

These fundamentals shaped the mindset needed for every subsequent project inside the lab.

## Key Takeaways

1. A strong grasp of networking concepts accelerates threat modeling.
2. Understanding OS internals demystifies privilege escalation techniques.
3. Automation with scripting languages saves time during investigations.
