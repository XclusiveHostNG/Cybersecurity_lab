# Exploitation Exercises

Practice exploiting known vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. Ensure you revert targets to clean snapshots after each run.

## Exercises

1. **vsFTPd Backdoor:** Trigger the malicious backdoor to obtain a shell on Metasploitable.
2. **Tomcat Manager Upload:** Deploy a WAR web shell to gain remote command execution.
3. **Samba MS08-067:** Use Metasploit or manual exploit code to compromise the service.
4. **Windows Lateral Movement:** Perform pass-the-hash using Impacket tools to move from the domain controller to the client.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Run `linpeas.sh` or `winPEAS.exe` to identify escalation paths and apply them.

## Rules of Engagement

- Only target machines within the lab networks.
- Record exploited CVEs and remediation suggestions.
- Notify collaborators before running denial-of-service payloads.

## Cleanup

- Revert to snapshots or execute cleanup scripts to remove shells/backdoors.
- Archive exploitation logs for defensive analysis.
- Update detection rules to cover observed techniques.
